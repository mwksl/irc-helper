Something to help cut down on trolls and alts as an OP

Right now, it's not pretty. 

All it can do at the moment is find all the usernames people have used when joining the channel, based on a hardcoded nick.

Right now, it takes a nick, checks all the ips/usernames that have logged in under this name and then checks all the nicks that have used those names. I'm thinking of making it quasi-recursive with a prompt before each recursion attempt. 

I'd like to make this about finding alts based on use of language, rather than ips/usernames... eventually. 

As of now I think it only works on Windows?
